# Important Note

This repository is only a mirror of the Linux version of PolSARpro. It does
contain all the files from `PolSARpro_v6.0_Biomass_Edition_Package_Linux.zip`,
which can be found in the zip file [PolSARpro_v6.0_Biomass_Edition_Linux_Installer_20190404.zip](https://www.ietr.fr/polsarpro-bio/Linux/PolSARpro_v6.0_Biomass_Edition_Linux_Installer_20190404.zip).
In other words: PolSARpro minus the files of the PolSARpro installer.

The primary purpose of having these files here is to aid in packaging PolSARpro
for [SARbian](https://github.com/EO-College/sarbian).
